# Simple iOS app using React Native
The Design for the app was inspired from [Here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/11280153/App4App-iPhone-app-design), Thanks to the designer for me letting me use this.

Icons used are from [http://www.flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com)

The App has been written for iOS only.

##Installation and run
Clone the repo and enter the following commands

`$ npm install`

`$ react-native run-ios`

##Additional Notes
I've Tried to use components which can ported to android easily as much as I can. Here is a list of the components I used which will work on android as well.

1. Navigator
2. View
3. Text
4. TouchableHighlight
5. ListView
6. Image

The only thing that I used which is iOS exclusive it the **TabBarIOS**

Finally, the code is really shabby and I will be refactoring it over time :)
